Welcome
=======


Thank you for your interest in joining the engineering team at UX Gorilla.

As a part of the selection process, we need you to complete a task of your choice.
A good 80-90% of the code that we write is in JavaScript, so we prefer that you complete the task using a JavaScript based technology.

Our engineers typically work across stack, which means that every engineer is given exposure to front-end, back-end, devOps, test automation and other responsibilities. 

But, we understand that you may have stronger skills in backend or frontend. That is why, for this round you have an option to either do a frontend task or a backend task.

Check out both the tasks and complete the one that you're most confident in...
